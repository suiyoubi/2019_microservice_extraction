Converts a bunch file to rigi standard format (.RSF). 
The .bunch file is generated using B. Mitchell's Bunch Clustering technique (github.com/ArchitectingSoftware/Bunch).
The output .RSF file can then be used as an input to the MoJo executable (http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~bil/downloads/), which functions as a metric for the % similarity of two different software architectures.
